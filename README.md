## Getting Started

Install this starter (assuming [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) is installed and updated) by running from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby new YourProjectName https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter
npm run develop # or gatsby develop
```

Or you can fork the project, make your changes there and merge new features when needed.

Alternatively:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter YourProjectName # Clone the project
cd YourProjectname
rm -rf .git # So you can have your own changes stored in VCS.
npm install # or yarn install
npm run develop # or gatsby develop
```
